Using Java & Database (SQL) with JDBC, the employees can do operations like book a ticket, cancel a ticket, print a final list of booked tickets, and update a seat capacity, and passengers can do operations like book a ticket, cancel a ticket, and print a ticket. This also comes with a login and new passenger registration. If a passenger cancels the ticket, the ticket will be allocated to an RAC passenger, and then an RAC ticket will be allocated to a waiting list passenger, and then one new ticket will be created under the waiting list
